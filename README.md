# Theoryscript
Web application for the realization of functional Music Theory

- Still in it's early phase 

The idea behind this is to create a system for describing the various aspects 
of music theory through pure programming functionality, hard coding as little data as possible.

The current functions are a pretty inelegant, just wanted to push out a site I can view. 

If you want to jump straight to the functions either go to the site and click Script at the top 
or jump to /src/helper/functions in the files!
